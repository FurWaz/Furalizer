Furalizer is a simple, customizable and powerful audio visualizer.

You can use it to play musics with a customized visualizer in realtime, but also to export and save the custom visualizer you just made !

Enjoy !

## Installation (Windows)
The whole application is already built for Windows in the \[/dist/furalizer/\] folder, you just have to run the executable \[furalizer.exe\].

## Installation (Linux / MacOS)
The application is not built for Linux (yet), you'll need to download and install pySFML for python, and execute the \[furalizer.py\] file with python to get it running.
